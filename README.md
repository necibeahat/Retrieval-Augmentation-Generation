# Retrieval-Generation-Augmentation
This notebook is a simple way to 

Data Processing
Import data into pandas
Create embeddings with SentenceTransformer
Build a RAG system

## Libraries
Pandas
[qdrant-client](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) -> vector similariy seach engine and vector database
[Sentence Transformers](https://pypi.org/project/sentence-transformers/) -> framework to computer dense erctor represetnation for sentences, paragraphs and images. The models are based on transformers like BERT / RoBERTa / XLM-RoBERTa. 
[torch](https://pypi.org/project/torch/) -> Tensor computation library with GPU acceleration. Deep neural netword that uses reverse-mode automatic differentiations. This technique computes gradient efficiently by using backpropagation.
