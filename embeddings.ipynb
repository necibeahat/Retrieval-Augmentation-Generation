The problems in the review shall be answered by the investigator or the person authorized by the investigator in the form of question until the question is closed.\\n1.5Medical coding The medical coder performs medical coding, including combined drugs and adverse events. Adverse events will be coded according to the MedDRA (20.0 or above) dictionary and the combined drugs will be classified by WHO ATC.\\nDuring the coding process, DM can question the investigator online in real time about failure of coding caused by improper, inaccurate or ambiguous medical terms provided.\\nA medical review is required for the medical coding before the database lock. 1.6External data management NA 1.7Data review meeting The study leader, statistician and data manager make the data review before statistical analysis to review the subject completion, protocol violation, adverse events, analysis data sets (including FAS, PPS and SS) to determine the attribution of each subject, judgment of missing value and treatment of outliers. Decisions made on the review meeting cannot be modified after the database lock, and any decisions must be documented.\\n1.8Electronic signature of investigator After the database is frozen, the investigator conducts electronic signature verification and shall sign the name again in case of data revision after signature.\\n1.9Data lock and export After the data in the database meets the quality requirements, a written approval document of database lock is signed by the data manager, statistical analyst and investigator representative according to the database lock procedures, exported by the data manager to the database of specified format and submitted to the statistician for statistical analysis. Statistical analysis See the \"Statistical analysis plan\" for the details of the statistical analysis. The statistician and the principal investigator finalize the plan according to the data characteristics through discussion before the database lock. This protocol only describes the basic statistical analysis content, and the actual content shall be subject to the statistical analysis plan.\\n2.1Analysis data set 2.1.1Full Analysis Set (FAS): a set of all cases randomized to use the study drug at least once.\\n2.1.2Per Protocol Set (PPS): a data set generated by subjects who have fully complied with the trial protocol, including treatment received, availability of primary endpoint measurement, and no significant violation of the trial protocol. Cases withdrawn due to inefficacy will also be included in PPS. PPS will be subject to the final classification of the data audit report.\\n2.1.3Safety Set (SS): a set of subjects who receive at least one treatment with a safety evaluation after randomization.\\n2.2Missing data processing method 2.2.1The subjects who have missing primary efficiency indicators are filled in according to the treatment failure, that is, the pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration does not convert to negative. Unless otherwise specified, the secondary efficiency indicators shall be included as observed data in the statistical analysis, and the missing data shall not be filled in.\\n2.2.2The safety data shall not be filled in. 2.3Statistical method 2.3.1General principle\\nDescription of statistics:\\nThe primary indicators collected in this study are described with statistical method. Quantitative indicators are described by means of mean, standard deviation, median, quartile, maximum, minimum and the like; qualitative indicators are described by frequency, percentage and the like.\\nStatistical test:\\nUnless otherwise specified, the statistical significance level is 0.05 by two-sided test (one-sided 0.025) and the 95% confidence interval shall be provided for the estimation of inter-group variance parameters.\\n2.3.2Characteristics of cases Subject distribution The population and the number of enrolled and completed cases in each center are listed, and three analysis data sets (FAS, PPS, SS) are determined.\\nA detailed list of the data set categories is made. The number and ratio of subjects who are randomly enrolled, complete the trial, and withdraw from the trial early and the reasons are calculated.\\nThe subject distribution flow chart is plotted. General information and baseline characteristics The demographic information, previous medication history and history of other diseases of the patients are described with statistical method. General information and baseline characteristics are described based on FAS.\\n2.3.3Analysis of drug exposure and drug combination Analysis based on SS. The drug exposure, dose intensity and exposure time of each group are calculated and subject to descriptive statistical analysis.\\nThe drug combination is coded by WHO ATC and summarized according to the ATC secondary classification and PT. The number and ratio of cases are calculated.\\n2.3.4Efficiency analysis Analysis based on FAS and PPS.\\nPrimary efficiency indicators:\\nThe primary effective indicators are complete antipyresis time, pulmonary imaging improvement indicators, and negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration.The non-inferiority evaluation is based on FAS. The statistical significance level is set to one-sided 0.025 and the non-inferiority critical value is set to -10%. The negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration in the trial group and positive control group is calculated respectively. The negative conversion ratio difference (trial group - control group) between the trial group and positive control group as well as the two-sided 95% confidence interval (95%CI) are calculated. The confidence interval is estimated by Miettinen-Nurminen. If the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than -10%, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is not inferior to the positive control drug. Given that the non-inferiority hypothesis is true, if it is further obtained that the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than 0, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is superior to the positive control drug. The inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimation results after the site effect control will be provided simultaneously as the sensitivity analysis and the sites with few subjects may be combined before analysis.\\nSecondary efficiency indicators:\\nThe secondary efficiency indicators include negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing on Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after administration, negative conversion time, immune-related indicators (lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, counts and percentages of CD4 and CD8), SOFA score, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. The secondary efficiency indicators are subject to descriptive statistical analysis according to the data type. Where, for the quantitative data, the observed values in each visit and the changes in the observed values from baseline after treatment are analyzed descriptively and provided with the inter-group difference estimate value (trial group - control group) of the changes in indicators in different visits from baseline and its 95% confidence interval; for the qualitative data, the indicators in different visits are described in the form of a frequency table (frequency and percentage) and provided with the inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimate; for the survival data, such as the negative conversion time of pathogen nucleic acid testing and complete antipyresis time, the median complete antipyresis time and its 95% confidence interval in each group are calculated by Kaplan-Meier, the information on the subject deletions at the end of the study is provided and the survivorship curve is provided. The hazard ratio HR and its 90% confidence interval of the trail group and the control group are estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression.\\n2.3.5Safety analysis SS data sets are used for safety analysis. Adverse events are coded according to the MedDRA. The occurrence of adverse events/reactions, serious adverse events/reactions and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is summarized and analyzed in the form of a frequency table (number of cases, case, and incidence).\\nThe occurrence of varying severity orders of adverse events/reactions, serious adverse events/reactions and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is subject to descriptive statistical analysis in the form of a frequency table (number of cases, case, and incidence) according to SOC and PT.\\nA detailed list of various adverse events/reactions, serious adverse events/reactions and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is made.\\nChanges in the clinical significance determination of laboratory indicators, ECG and physical examination at each visit after administration and baseline test results are described in the form of crosstab.\\nThe laboratory indexes and vital signs examination are subject to descriptive statistical analysis according to trial grouping and visits.\\nA detailed list of laboratory indexes, ECG, and clinically significant physical abnormalities is made.\\n2.4Analysis software Use the software SAS with version 9.4 or above for analysis. 2.5Interim analysis and multiplicity control In order to obtain relevant study results as soon as possible to support follow-up scientific research and clinical practice, this study plans to conduct staged efficacy and safety data analysis at the sample size of 65, 130 and 260 cases.

Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.\\nThe EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'.\\nGlobal tissue dysoxia [\\xa0Time\\xa0Frame:\\xa0Days 1, 3, 7\\xa0]Assessed by serum lactate concentration\\nOrgan function (including renal function) [\\xa0Time\\xa0Frame:\\xa0Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, 28\\xa0]Assessed by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.

Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.\\nThe EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'.\\nGlobal tissue dysoxia [\\xa0Time\\xa0Frame:\\xa0Days 1, 3, 7\\xa0]Assessed by serum lactate concentration\\nOrgan function (including renal function) [\\xa0Time\\xa0Frame:\\xa0Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, 28\\xa0]Assessed by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.
