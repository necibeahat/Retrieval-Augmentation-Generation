I know how much power is at the core of the wine, and so I find it fantastically seductive the way it pulls you in to explore its depths. At first it exhibits dark undertones of smoked cayenne, musk, and ripe plums, yet as it is exposed to air in the glass it slowly unfolds and expresses compelling organic aromas of peat, nutmeg, and savory grilled steak juices. The wine is incredibly soft and silky on the front of the palate, and gains an amazing amount of weight as it glides to the back. The texture is delicious and draws you back so easily with its elegant, lingering finish. Given the nature of the wines self expression at this time, I recommend 3 years of cellar age, and with that you will be handsomely rewarded. With the freshness of the acidity and the coating texture to the tannin, I anticipate a long lived bottle age of 20 or more year.'} score: 0.5496862205911546\n",
